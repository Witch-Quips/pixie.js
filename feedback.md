# Pixie.js Feedback

Good work this week friends - I know you had a lot of ideas but I think what you settled on was really cool. 

- I would move positions and suits to their own controllers
- I noticed that you don't have any authorization or authentication -- you likely would want this so that any user can't be adding to your API
- If you keep working on this, pagination would be a nice feature to add since there are so many cards
- Homepage is awesome :)
- Overall it looks good - lots of nice clean code -- be sure to delete any remnant comments
